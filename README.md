### Hi, I'm Konrad Staniszewski, a computer (software) engineering new grad from the University of Alberta. Currently @Arista

I like webdev, react, node, rust, and a bunch of other technologies. Big physics nerd, and love doing outdoor sports.

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on rewriting my blog with Next.js for the third time.

- âš¡ Fun fact: The F-1 rocket engine (5 of which powered the Saturn V) required 150,000 litres of fuel and oxidizer a minute.
