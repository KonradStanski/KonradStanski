### Hi, I'm Konrad Staniszewski, a computer (software) engineering new grad from the University of Alberta. Currently @Arista

I like systems programming, webdev, embedded, react, node, rust, and a bunch of other technologies. Big physics nerd, and love doing outdoor sports.

- 🔭 I’m currently figuring how to recreate Mint using open source tools
- :airplane: Van 🇨🇦
- 🤔 For opportunities, contact me @ konrad.a.staniszewski@gmail.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: The F-1 rocket engine (5 of which powered the Saturn V) required 150,000 litres of fuel and oxidizer a minute.
