### Hi, I'm Konrad Staniszewski, a 4th year computer engineering student at the Univeristy of Alberta.

I'm interested in web development, data visualization, machine learning, embedded systems, networking, quantum computing, 3D printing, physics, electronics, and many outdoor sports.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a win32 utility called winreturn that functions like macos's [Stay](https://cordlessdog.com/stay/).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning flutter.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with figuring out the win32 api and why it is the way it is.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about [Notion](https://notion.com). It's pretty great.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Email me @ konrad.a.staniszewsi@gmail.com
