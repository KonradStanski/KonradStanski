### Hi, I'm Konrad Staniszewski, a 4th year computer engineering student at the Univeristy of Alberta.

I like webdev, react, node, rust, wasm, and a bunch of other technologies. Big physics nerd, and love doing outdoor sports.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on making my blog with Next.js using the notion api as a CMS.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently finishing my degree
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for job opportunities! Contact me @ konrad.a.staniszewski@gmail.com
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about [Notion](https://notion.com). It's pretty great.
- âš¡ Fun fact: The F-1 rocket engine (5 of which powered the Saturn V) required 150,000 litres of fuel and oxidizer a minute.
